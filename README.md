# Covid-Vaccines

This repo contains two subfolders:
- `Data`
- `Scripts`

**Data**

The `Data` folder only contains a list of Twitter User IDs.

**Scripts**

The `Scripts` folder only contains analysis scripts. These scripts require the data to be in a specific format, which is not provided in the `Data` folder. The `Scripts` folder does not contain the necessary collection and processing scripts that enable the analysis scripts. In order to replicate findings, please navigate outside of this repo and move into the Covid repo, which will provide the collection and processing steps.

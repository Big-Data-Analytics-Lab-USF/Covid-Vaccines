# Covid-Vaccines

This repo contains two subfolders:
- `Data`
- `Scripts`

**Data**

The `Data` folder contains a list of Twitter User IDs and Twitter ID strings.

**Scripts**

The `Scripts` folder only contains analysis scripts. These scripts require the data to be in a specific format, which is not provided in the `Data` folder. The `Scripts` folder does not contain the necessary collection and processing scripts that enable the analysis scripts. In order to replicate findings, please navigate outside of this repo and move into the Covid repo, which will provide the collection and processing steps.

**Keywords**

The `covid19_keywords.txt` is a list of keywords we used to collect Covid19 related Twitter Data. 

The `vaccine_keywords.txt` is a list of keywords we used to parse our Covid19 related Twitter Dataset to use in this anaylsis.
